        <h1>My Top Picks</h1>
            <em>My Top 3 Movies </em>
                <p>Third in my list of top movies is  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6az9wGfeSgM">Spirited Away</a>. This is my first Studio Ghibli movie. I like this movie because it contains a lot of moral lessons and everyone can enjoy this movie. There’s also a little love team that makes me hope for a sequel. 
                </p>
                <p>The second spot in my list is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLhEb6IG1k">Wolf Children</a>. This one really moved me in an unexpected way. Although i could not relate to the main character, her attitude towards certain circumstances in her life inspired me to be strong. It also has a wonderful soundtrack that matches the mood of every scene. The art is also very beautiful. This was one of the movies that makes me ugly cry. So beautiful! I definitely recommend this movie.

                <p>My top movie is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRPEpJHI9zg">The Sound of Music</a>. This one is a really special movie and will always be my number one because aside from the classic Disney movies, i consider this as my first favorite movie. I decided this when i was in grade 3. This is also my first musical film. After so many years, i can still sing along to the soundtrack with gusto.

            <em>My Top 3 Tunes</em>
                <p>Third in my list is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhqF6hWOfc0">Best Friend (Acoustic)</a> by Amy Winehouse. I just love how the acoustic guitar sets an intimate vibe in the song. I intend to learn how to play the song on the guitar as soon as i can. Nothing really special but songs that can motivate me to learn how to play it is a special thing and is ought to have a spot in this list.

                <p>The second in my list is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jzhZFsHd34">Tooi Sakebi</a> by Reichi Nakaido.  I’ve been listening to blues lately, and while i was searching for an anime to binge watch, i came across Serial Experiments Lain and heard this song at the end of the anime. One listen and i was captivated immediately. I just like any music that sounds good (to me) apparently. So easy to please(hahaha). I like the “sad song to listen to while drinking beer in a pub” vibe of this song.
                </p>
                <p>Last and definitely not the least would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY">Yellow</a> by Coldplay. This is my most favorite of all ever since high school, and i still get chills when i listen to this especially to the live versions. i love the intensity of the lyrics and its meaning: doing anything for the person that you love even if you bleed from it, feel pain, encounter hurdles just for that special person. I could say that this would be my love song to that special person in my life who i have yet to meet in the future..If i ever went to a Coldplay concert and they play this, i’ll definitely cry.
