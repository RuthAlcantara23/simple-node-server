        <h1>Journey</h1>
        
                <img src="C;//home/user/Downloads/baby.jpg" alt="b3hb3h"><p>I was born here in the Philippines but for approximately 5 years i grew up in Ohio, USA with my family because my dad was taking his Phd at Ohio State University. I cannot rememember much of my life there but all i know was that i thoroughly enjoyed my childhood there. when we went back to the Philippines, i could barely understand my relatives and i could not speak Tagalog at that time. The rest of my childhood life was your typical 90's childhood: Playing hide and seek, watch cartoons, etc. I was pretty normal except for the fact that i did not talk much in my elementary days. I don't know why but i did not want people to hear my voice. I really don't know maybe i was just a weird kid back then. My elementary days were pretty much normal but i could say that 4th to 6th grade were the most memorable days of my life. This is were i met friends who made my elementary days memorable. I was pretty sad when i reached 6th grade because this would be our last year together. We graduated and i hoped that we would be able to contact each other even if we ended up in different schhols.

                <p>Upon reaching high school, I had mixed feelings. I was excited and also nervous because high school seemed a bit intimidating: New acquainatances, teachers, and harder subjects. But i was glad because i knew one friendly face in the sea of first year students. I was able to enjoy that first year of my high school life but i felt like i was a bit left out because i had very little in common with my set of friends back then. That first year came by like a flash. The remaining 2nd to 4th year of high school was the best because here, i was finally able to establish my self with friends that i can relate to and we all had the same kind of humor. That made high school more tolerable. I had a bit of a hard time in math back then. I was so scared that i would repeat a year, but thankfully i didn't and i BARELY pass. You could say that my Math scores were an equivalent of 3.00 here in UPLB hahaha. I was not really exceptional in my studies and i did not partcipate much in extra curricular activites. But all in all, my high school life is fun.
                </p>
                <p>Today, i am now a university student here in UPLB and i am hoping that i will finish my Bachelor's Degree as soon as possible and that i would be able to do my best in my academics. I live a pretty normal life, same as i did back then but i can say that i grew as a person. I am currently not in any college organizations right now becase i fear that i would become more distracted from my studies, and i prefer to stay at home and watch anime rather than go to parties and group assemblies. I play the acoustic guitar in our church, and i hope to become a more skilled musician in the future.
                </p>
                <p>Hopefully my future will be a good one and i hope to do well in life so that i can have a bright future.

            <em>My Top 3 Tunes</em>
                <p>Third in my list is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhqF6hWOfc0">Best Friend (Acoustic)</a> by Amy Winehouse. I just love how the acoustic guitar sets an intimate vibe in the song. I intend to learn how to play the song on the guitar as soon as i can. Nothing really special but songs that can motivate me to learn how to play it is a special thing and is ought to have a spot in this list.
                </p>
                <p>The second in my list is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jzhZFsHd34">Tooi Sakebi</a> by Reichi Nakaido.  I’ve been listening to blues lately, and while i was searching for an anime to binge watch, i came across Serial Experiments Lain and heard this song at the end of the anime. One listen and i was captivated immediately. I just like any music that sounds good (to me) apparently. So easy to please(hahaha). I like the “sad song to listen to while drinking beer in a pub” vibe of this song.
                </p>
                <p>Last and definitely not the least would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfVyz0-fjzU">Sakura Mitsutsuki</a> by Spyair. I can’t exactly remember how i found this song but i guess i was randomly searching for opening and ending songs from Gintama and came across this song. I instantly loved the song and especially the guitar solo at the bridge part still gives me chills.
