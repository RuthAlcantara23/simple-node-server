        <h1>The Journey So Far...</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="/public/images/b3hb3h.jpg" width="125" style="float: left"></a>I was born here in the Philippines but for approximately 5 years i grew up in Ohio, <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> with my family because my dad was taking his PhD at Ohio State University. I cannot rememember much of my life there but all i know was that i thoroughly enjoyed my childhood there. When we went back to the Philippines, i could barely understand my relatives and i could not speak Tagalog at that time. The rest of my childhood life was your typical 90's childhood: Playing hide and seek, watch cartoons, etc. I was pretty normal except for the fact that i did not talk much in my elementary days. I don't know why but i did not want people to hear my voice. I really don't know maybe i was just a weird kid back then. My elementary days were pretty much normal but i could say that 4th to 6th grade were the most memorable days of my life. This is were i met friends who made my elementary days memorable. I was pretty sad when i reached 6th grade because this would be our last year together. We graduated and i hoped that we would be able to contact each other even if we ended up in different schhols.

Those days were definitely my <em>j3hj3h</em> days. Upon reaching high school, I had mixed feelings. I was excited and also nervous because high school seemed a bit intimidating: New acquainatances, teachers, and harder subjects. But i was glad because i knew one friendly face in the sea of first year students. I was able to enjoy that first year of my high school life but i felt like i was a bit left out because i had very little in common with my set of friends back then. That first year came by like a flash. The remaining 2nd to 4th year of high school was the best because here, i was finally able to establish my self with friends that i can relate to and we all had the same kind of humor. That made high school more tolerable. We still keep in touch through Facebook and we try to hang out despite their(because they are all working now) heavy schedules. I had a bit of a hard time in math back then. I was so scared that i would repeat a year, but thankfully i didn't and i BARELY pass. You could say that my Math scores were an equivalent of 3.00 here in <abbr title="University of the Philippines">UPLB</abbr> hahaha. I was not really exceptional in my studies and i did not partcipate much in extra curricular activites. But all in all, my high school life is fun.

I live a pretty normal life, same as i did back then but i can say that i grew as a person. I am currently not in any college organizations right now becase i fear that i would become more distracted from my studies, and i prefer to stay at home and watch anime rather than go to parties and group assemblies and whatever else you do in an organion.

        <p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://www.google.com.ph/"><img src="/images/futureself.png" alt="This is my future self" width="125" style="float:left"></a>And now, i just hope that my future will be a good one and i will do well in life so that i can have a bright future. I want my future job to be something that i am good at and it is something i enjoy doing. I play the acoustic guitar in our church, and i hope to become a more skilled musician in the future. I also wish to have a family and that my parents would still be alive to see their apos.
